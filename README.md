# chatgpt-safari-15.6.1
This Safari extension fixes an issue in Safari 15.6.1 that prevents you from scrolling a chat, due to an issue with CSS overlay style.

Turn on developer mode in Safari and open the app. Allow permission for use on chatgpt.com and it should start scrolling again.

Could I use a different browser to fix it? Yes.

Am I going to do that? No.
